# Higgs-Boson-Particle-Detector

The Standard Model that explains the forces of nature hypothesizes that proof of the existence of a Higgs Boson particle provides a potential answer to why particles are attributed with mass. This study aims to replicate the neural network design presented in the paper published in 2014 ["Searching for exotic particles in high-energy physics with deep learning"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.4735.pdf) using a TensorFlow framework as well as consider potential improvements over the current architecture provided. 

The neural network is configured to discriminate Higgs boson particles from background noise using Monte Carlo simulated data for the classification task.
